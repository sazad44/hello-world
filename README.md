# hello-world
Print "hello world" from a few lines of code as a time-honored tradition in programming education.
Hi, my name's Samie and I am applying to Holberton to become a full-stack software developer. I have created this github account to apply to their program, and I am performing this hello world code because I enjoy coding.
